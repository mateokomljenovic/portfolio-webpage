February to March Challenge is to create and practice everything I know so far. I am going to create this page and put all my content here instead of using WordPress.

//Added simple design using bootstrap.
//Navigation should have a sandwich opening with JS

//Blog should be similar to portfolio section 

//About me should be simple and

//Each item on navigation list should have it's own page.
